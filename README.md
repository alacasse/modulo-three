# Modulo Three

A Moore machine implementation that computes the remainder of a binary input string when divided by three.

## Overview

This project implements a deterministic finite automaton with output (Moore machine) designed to process binary input sequences and determine their remainder modulo 3. The machine maintains its current state as the accumulated remainder, transitioning between states based on each input digit processed.
